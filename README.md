# IPS Shortlist

This repository contains the shortlist script and dataset.

## Project structure
- `shortlist.py`: Script entrypoint (WIP)
- `final_2024_agegroup_sex_race_education.csv`: Baseline dataset
- `data/`: Local working data directory (ignored by Git)
- `.gitignore`: Ignores Python artifacts, editor files, and `data/`

## Notes
- Keep large/derived files in `data/` so they are not committed.
- Default branch is `main`.
